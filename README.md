# 4D-namespaces-registry

This page is a curated list of [namespaces](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Extensions/develop-components#declaring-the-component-namespace) used by published 4D components, both by 4D and by developers.

The aim is to avoid using an identifier that is already in use, and thus avoid ending up with 2 components using the same namespace.

> â“˜ NOTE    
A namespace ensures that no conflict emerges when a host project uses different components that have classes or functions with identical names.

Before choosing a namespace for your component, we recommend you consult the list below to avoid duplicating names. Once you've defined the name you'd like to use, and to keep it unique, submit it for referencing. To do this, please read the [Guidelines for contributions](contributing.md).
