## If we ask you to update your Pull Request

It is often difficult to ensure that a Pull Request complies with the above standards. If the maintainers notice something we'd like to change, we'll ask you to edit your Pull Request before merging it. There's no need to open a new Pull Request, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do this, [here's a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) to the different ways you can update your Pull Request so we can merge it.
